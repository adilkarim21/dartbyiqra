            <h1 class="text-white blogMainHeading">Privacy Policies</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">Privacy Policy for Resin Art Business</span><br>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines the practices and procedures implemented by the resin art business ("Company") regarding the collection, use, and protection of personal information obtained from customers ("Customers") during the course of conducting business. By engaging with the Company's services, the Customers consent to the terms of this Policy.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">1.Information Collection</span>: a. The Company may collect personal information from Customers, including but not limited to names, contact details (e.g., email address, phone number), shipping address, and payment information. b. Personal information is collected when Customers place orders, communicate with the Company's representatives, sign up for newsletters or promotions, or otherwise voluntarily provide information.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">2.Information Sharing</span>: a. The Company may share personal information with trusted third-party service providers, such as shipping carriers or payment processors, to facilitate order fulfillment, delivery, and payment processing. These third parties are obligated to protect the personal information and use it solely for the specified purposes.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">3.Floral Work Policy</span>: If you want us to use our rose or gajra, then please keep in mind that every rose or petal color varies. The ones we post are those sent to us by clients and the ones we purchase are different because we don't know how they dried that naturally. So please don't come to us complaining that this is not what I ordered. Why is the gajra not purely red like your video ones? Actually, Those are sent to us by clients. Otherwise, please send us your stuff. We'll appreciate the kindness.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">4.Dried Packet Flower Work</span>: While working with dried packet flowers for our resin business, if you receive something similar to our article but with different flowers and leaves of the same theme, it is acceptable. This is because the same items are not always available in stock, and restocking takes almost a month as we personally import these materials. In the resin business, minor variations are acceptable and expected.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">5.Same Design and Colour</span>: Resin is a handmade business, and we do not use any robots or machines that can create exact replicas of our designs. Even if machines could do so, they would not be able to maintain the same level of uniqueness. Resin art is a flow art, and the movement of colors can alter the final design in ways we cannot control. Additionally, the color you ordered might be slightly different due to variations in new supplies.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">6.Parcel Delivery</span>: Our company has an account with Leopards for delivery, which typically takes 3-5 working days. If you require urgent delivery, we can use an overnight service, but the client will be responsible for the additional cost. If a client requests urgent delivery but is not willing to pay the extra charges, we are not responsible for any delays, as we have provided the option for urgent delivery.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">7.Return Policy</span>: Returns are only acceptable if an item is broken or if it significantly deviates from your design. Minimal differences do not qualify for returns, as our items are handmade. Please refer to our above policy to understand this point. If can fix it but cannot make a return payment.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">8.Data Security</span>: a. The Company implements reasonable security measures to protect the personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. b. However, the transmission of information over the internet or electronic storage is not completely secure, and the Company cannot guarantee the absolute security of the data. Customers provide their personal information at their own risk.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">9.Cookies and Tracking Technologies</span>: a. The Company's website may use cookies or similar tracking technologies to enhance the browsing experience and gather information about website usage patterns. b. Customers have the option to disable cookies in their web browsers. However, this may limit certain features or functionality of the website.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">10.Updates to the Privacy Policy</span>: a. The Company may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Customers are encouraged to review the Policy periodically to stay informed about how their information is being used and protected.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">11.Contact Information</span>: a. For any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of personal information, Customers may contact the Company using the provided contact details.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date indicated below and shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Company is located.</p>
